# HTML CSS NOTE

## Float

[source](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/float) - checkout float in mdn

The float CSS property specifies that an element should be placed along the left or right side of its container, allowing text and inline elements to wrap around it. The element is removed from the normal flow of the web page, though still remaining a part of the flow.

## How floated elements are positioned?
As mentioned above, when an element is floated, it is taken out of the normal flow of the document(though still remaining part of it). It is shifted to the left, or right, until it touches the edge of its containers box, or another floated element.
